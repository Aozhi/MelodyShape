abstract = {This short paper describes four submissions to the Symbolic Melodic Similarity task of the MIREX 2010 edition. All four submissions rely on a local-alignment approach between sequences of n-grams, and they differ mainly on the substitution score between two n-grams. This score is based on a geometric representation that shapes musical pieces as curves in the pitch-time plane. One of the systems described ranked first for all ten effectiveness measures used and the other three ranked from second to fifth, depending on the measure.},

abstract = {We present a new geometric model to compute the melodic similarity of symbolic musical pieces. Melodies are represented as splines in the pitch-time plane, and their similarity is computed as the similarity of their shape. The model is very intuitive and it is transposition and time scale invariant. We have implemented it with a local alignment algorithm over sequences of n-grams that define spline spans. An evaluation with the MIREX 2005 collections shows that the model performs very well, obtaining the best effectiveness scores ever reported for these collections. Three systems based on this new model were evaluated in MIREX 2010, and the three systems obtained the best results.},

abstract = {This short paper describes our five submissions to the 2012 edition of the MIREX Symbolic Melodic Similarity task. All five submissions rely on a geometric model that represents melodies as spline curves in the pitch-time plane. The similarity between two melodies is then computed with a sequence alignment algorithm between sequences of spline spans: the more similar the shape of the curves, the more similar the melodies they represent. As in MIREX 2010 and 2011, our systems ranked first for all effectiveness measures used. However, this year there was only one competing system, so we employ this report mainly to describe and compare results within our systems.},
