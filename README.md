MelodyShape
===========

MelodyShape is an open source Java library and tool to compute the melodic similarity between monophonic music pieces. It implements several algorithms that compute similarity based on the geometric shape that melodies describe in the pitch-time plane.

All these algorithms have obtained the best results in the [MIREX](http://music-ir.org/mirex/wiki/MIREX_HOME) Symbolic Melodic Similarity task in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 editions, as well as the best results reported for the 2005 collection.
